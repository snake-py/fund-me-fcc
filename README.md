# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Tests with hardhat

Testing is seperated into unit testing and staging testing. Basically unit tests are run locally while staging tests are run on a staging network (GÃ¶rli, Rinkeby, etc).
